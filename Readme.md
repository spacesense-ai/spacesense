## About
Many sources of satellite imagery exists:
* from ESA, with Copernicus and the Sentinel missions
* from NASA, with the Landsat missions
* from private companies, like Planet and so much more to come

The package `spacesense.ai` give the tools to query, download, process images from several sources, and build efficient models to generate intelligence.

The package is currently  being developed. 
Nothing much works for now...
[Keep in touch](https://www.spacesense.ai/) to the first version soon to come.
